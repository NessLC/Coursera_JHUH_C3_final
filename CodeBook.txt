CODE BOOK

================================================================================
i. The run_analysis.R file contains the script with the 5 steps required in the 
course. 
ii.  The data set is downloaded and extracted in the folder UCI HAR Dataset

================================================================================

1. step 1 merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
To do this, each of the following documents is assigned to a variable as follows:

features <- features.txt with col.names "n","functions"
activitys <- activity_labels.txt with col.names "code","activity"
subjecttest <- subject_test.txt with col.names  "subject"
xtest <- X_test.txt with col.names = features$functions
ytest <-y_test.txt" with col.names "code"
subjecttrain <-subject_train.txt with col.names "subject"
xtrain <- X_train.txt with col.names = features$functions
ytrain <- y_train.txt with col.names  "code"

then simply mergs row by row for xtrain and xtest to xdf, ytrain and ytest to ydf, subjecttrain and subjecttest subjects and fynaly merge the columns to make completedf

2. Step 2 extracts only the mean and standard deviation from each measurement.

To achieve this, only the columns containing the mean and std terms as well as the subject and code were selected.

3. Step 3 use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

These names are stored in the activitys table. then this code column is replaced by the activity name.

4. Step 4 Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. To do this, various expression substitutions were used to make the names legible. gsub function and some regular expressions were used. 

finally saved in tidydata

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

To achieve this, only tidydata was grouped by subject and activity and that result was passed to the summarize_all function so that could compute the mean of each group. that is saved in finaldata table and in FinalData.txt file 

===============================================================================
For each record in the original data set it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.
