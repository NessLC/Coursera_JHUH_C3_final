CODE BOOK

=====================================================================================================================
i. The run_analysis.R file contains the script with the 5 steps required in the course. 
ii.  The data set is downloaded and extracted in the folder UCI HAR Dataset

=======================================================================================================================

1. step 1 merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
To do this, each of the following documents is assigned to a variable as follows:

features <- features.txt with col.names "n","functions"
activitys <- activity_labels.txt with col.names "code","activity"
subjecttest <- subject_test.txt with col.names  "subject"
xtest <- X_test.txt with col.names = features$functions
ytest <-y_test.txt" with col.names "code"
subjecttrain <-subject_train.txt with col.names "subject"
xtrain <- X_train.txt with col.names = features$functions
ytrain <- y_train.txt with col.names  "code"

then simply mergs row by row for xtrain and xtest to xdf, ytrain and ytest to ydf, subjecttrain and subjecttest subjects and fynaly merge the columns to make completedf

2. Step 2 extracts only the mean and standard deviation from each measurement.

To achieve this, only the columns containing the mean and std terms as well as the subject and code were selected.

3. Step 3 use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

These names are stored in the activitys table. then this code column is replaced by the activity name.

4. Step 4 Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. To do this, various expression substitutions were used to make the names legible. gsub function and some regular expressions were used. 

finally saved in tidydata

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

To achieve this, only tidydata was grouped by subject and activity and that result was passed to the summarize_all function so that could compute the mean of each group. that is saved in finaldata table and in FinalData.txt file
